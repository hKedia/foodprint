* Fresh Green: The very first thing that comes to our mind when we hear about fresh farms is the color 'Green'. The color depicts the essence of the word 'agriculture'.

* Cool Blue: The second thing that we imagine is the sky above the farms. The light shade of blue effectively facilitates the subtle intricacies in the design.

* Tangy Orange: The playful orange color completes the Triad of the color wheel thus forming a harmonic balance of colors. It is utilised for gaining user's attention for action buttons.

* Nearly White: This shade of really light grey is used to form the base foundation for the design elements which will complete the whole design.

* Almost Black: It's a very dark shade of blue used to reduce the sharp contrast of pure black on a light background for the reader.
